# Retinal blood vessel segmentation in high resolution fundus photographs using automated feature parameter estimation

Created by José Ignacio Orlando at Pladema Institute (Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, UNCPBA, Tandil, Argentina) and CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, Argentina). This work was part of the Software Engineering thesis of Marcos Fracchia and Valeria del Río.

## Introduction
This repository contains implementation details and results of our method for blood vessel segmentation in high resolution images based on automated parameter estimation.
A preprint of our paper will be made available soon. Code is available on demand.

So far, the repository includes:

1. Results of our segmentation method as evaluated on HRF.
2. Model configuration.
3. Quantitative results for each image.

## Citing
Our paper is still under review. Please do not use this repository in your research until we release a valid citation to include.

The core of this method is our previous approach, so if you want to use its original version you can access it [here](https://github.com/ignaciorlando/fundus-vessel-segmentation-tbme).
